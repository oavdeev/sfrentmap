A web based tool for transplants to help choosing neighborhood to live in San Francisco

I've made it for myself when I was moving to SF, this is essentially a google maps mashup with following layers:

* Craigslist apartment search within specified price range. Not very convenient for finding specific apartment, but shows all apartments at once giving you rough idea where you are more likely to find an apartment with your budget

* Distance tool

* Area compare tool. Allows you to select an area (polygon) in your home town and then project it onto San Francisco map, preserving distances between points

* Bar radar and heatmap

As of this writing, the tool is available at http://maps.usrlib.com.
